# The measurements from SeNorge is done over a square kilometer, which means the area can have large differences in elevation.
# Snow is very dependent on elevation. There is more snow on higher altitudes. 
# Since the reliaiblity analysis is reliant on a characteristic value for snow load the elevation plays a major role.
# To deal with this, elevation_points.py locates a grid of points that is within this square kilometer.
# The elevation can then be found for each of these points in elevation.py. Then the characteristic load calculation can
# for example use the average value for elevation. The method for finding these points is to first find the center of the square.
# The center of all squares is the point listed in the data set. So when a point is found in this data set it is the center.
# Then a grid of points around the center is generated and if the generated point is closest to the center in question it is 
# appended to the list of coordinates. This list will then contain all the points included in the measurement of snow.
# The function that finds the point closest to a coordinate uses a "brute force" method, because the more efficient "nearest" method 
# gave wrong results.
